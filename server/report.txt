Problems We Ran Into

Abby:
One problem that I faced was that I originally began to write a program that catered solely to FTP and not considering
the implementation using TCP sockets. This created a predicament for me that was able to be solved with the help of my 
partners. They helped me realize that we needed to use clientSocket to send and receive information back and forth from
the client to the server. (Like we've been doing all semester).
